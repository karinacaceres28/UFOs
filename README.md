# UFOs

## Overview Project
The purpose of this project was to create a website using JavaScript, providing an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The webpage created needed a table allowing users to simultaneously filter through various criteria. The filter including the date, city, state, country, and shape.

The portion of the webpage allowing for the user to filter the desired criteria. The user is provided with the date, city, state, country, and shape to filter through. It important to note that every item filtered must be typed in all lowercase. The filter resets by clicking the “UFO Sightings” at the top left corner of the page.

## Summary

### Drawbacks of the Webpage
   •	 No spell correction. The user must enter everything correctly.
   •	 The user had to type in all lowercase. Typing in uppercase did not show when filtering.

### Recommendations
   •	 Allowing the user to filter regardless of upper/lowercase.
   •	 Allowing the user to have the option of filtering through months of years (eg. 1/2010). The website calls for specific dates.
